The **Handwriting Classification** project was conceived to identify and classify learning disabilities, known as Specific Learning Disorders (DSA), in preschool children through a series of specific tasks. These tasks include drawing, copying shapes, and writing sentences or numbers, each designed to reveal potential difficulties in various cognitive areas of the child.

The primary goal of this study is the early diagnosis of learning disabilities in children. By identifying these issues promptly, appropriate therapies can be provided by psychologists and psychotherapists. Early and targeted intervention can significantly improve therapeutic outcomes, allowing these disabilities to be addressed before they become more ingrained and difficult to manage.

The project employs advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze children's handwriting patterns. These algorithms enable accurate and reliable classification of potential learning disabilities. Utilizing these technologies makes the project a valuable tool for specialists, providing concrete and timely support in identifying children's needs. 


## üåü Inspiration
The data collection technique that enabled us to engage preschool subjects was storytelling. Specifically, we used a charming narrative to capture the children's interest and cooperation:

*"This is the story of Bipi, a little Martian who has come to Earth to explore our world, and Hanumi, the monkey who will help him learn about the things humans do. Bipi wants to learn what people do on planet Earth. For example, he wants to go to school like human children to learn how to draw and write. Can you help him see how it's done?"*

Through this engaging story, children were motivated to perform the tasks assigned to them. The narrative not only captivated their imagination but also provided a context in which they could relate to the activities. This approach proved effective in making the children feel comfortable and enthusiastic about participating in the study.

By framing the tasks within the story, we were able to collect data in a natural and stress-free manner. The children, engrossed in helping Bipi and Hanumi, approached the drawing, shape copying, and writing tasks with genuine interest and effort. This method ensured that the data collected was reflective of their true abilities, without the pressure often associated with formal testing environments.

The use of storytelling as a data collection method highlights the importance of creating a child-friendly and engaging atmosphere. It acknowledges that preschool children respond positively to imaginative and interactive scenarios, which can significantly enhance their willingness to participate and the quality of the data obtained. This innovative approach not only facilitated the data collection process but also underscored the potential of using creative techniques in educational and psychological research.

## üíæ Data Collection
The collected dataset comes from various subjects who were asked to complete 21 tasks. Each subject was provided with a graphic tablet and a small monitor to perform the tasks, with the writing unit (the pen) potentially varying during the task.

These classes allow users to specify input sizes, hidden layer dimensions, output sizes, and dropout rates, facilitating flexibility in model design. On the ML front, the file includes implementations of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), which support model training, prediction, and hyperparameter tuning through grid search. Each class inherits from abstract base classes that define common interfaces for training, predicting, and evaluating models, ensuring consistency and ease of use across different model types.

- The **`train.py`** script is designed for training and evaluating deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models using PyTorch and scikit-learn. It begins by importing essential libraries and utilities such as `torch`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, and custom modules like `dataset_management` and `model_classes`. The script defines functions for training deep learning models (`define_and_run_RNN`, `define_and_run_LSTM`, `define_and_run_GRU`) and evaluating them over multiple epochs using training and validation datasets. These functions utilize configurable model architectures (RNN, LSTM, GRU) specified in a YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`). The training process includes setting up model parameters, optimizer (e.g., Adam), and learning rate scheduler (`StepLR`). During training, progress and metrics are logged, including average loss and validation accuracy. Additionally, the script provides utilities for logging experiment metrics and visualizing results using tools like `matplotlib`.

It integrates key functionalities including loading model configurations from YAML files, initializing model architectures (e.g., LSTM, GRU) with predefined parameters, and loading pretrained weights from saved model checkpoints. Additionally, the script computes evaluation metrics such as classification reports and confusion matrices, which are subsequently saved to designated directories.

- The **`utils.py**`** module provides essential utility functions for managing machine learning and deep learning workflows. It includes functionality for loading configurations from YAML files and saving visualizations of confusion matrices and classification reports as heatmap images. Additionally, the module offers tools for plotting training and validation loss over epochs. The utility functions also encompass printing confusion matrices and classification reports in a readable format. Furthermore, the module features methods to compute and print various classification metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with generating a detailed classification report. An evaluation function for neural network models is also implemented, which computes evaluation metrics on a validation set and returns them in a structured format.
